Title: [ANN] MathCore 0.3.0 - Symbolic math library for Rust (like SymPy but for Rust!)

Hey everyone! 

I'm excited to share MathCore, a symbolic mathematics library I've been working on. It brings computer algebra system capabilities to Rust.

## What it does

- **Symbolic math**: Parse and manipulate expressions like "x^2 + 2*x + 1"
- **Calculus**: Differentiate and integrate symbolically
- **Equation solving**: From simple linear to complex polynomial equations  
- **Differential equations**: Solve ODEs and PDEs
- **Matrix operations**: Powered by nalgebra
- **Arbitrary precision**: BigInt/BigRational for exact arithmetic
- **And more**: FFT, complex numbers, numerical methods

## Quick example

```rust
use mathcore::MathCore;

fn main() {
    let math = MathCore::new();
    
    // Symbolic differentiation
    let derivative = MathCore::differentiate("sin(x^2)", "x").unwrap();
    println!("{}", derivative); // 2*x*cos(x^2)
    
    // Solve equations
    let roots = MathCore::solve("x^2 - 5*x + 6", "x").unwrap();
    // roots: [2, 3]
    
    // Evaluate with variables
    let result = math.calculate("2*pi*r", &[("r", 5.0)]).unwrap();
    // result: 31.415...
}
```

## Why another math library?

I needed symbolic math in Rust for a physics simulation project. While there are great numerical libraries, I couldn't find a comprehensive CAS for Rust. MathCore fills that gap.

Title: Show HN: MathCore ‚Äì A Symbolic Math Library for Rust

I built MathCore to bring symbolic mathematics capabilities to Rust, inspired by systems like SymPy and Mathematica.

The library handles symbolic expression manipulation, calculus, equation solving, and differential equations. It uses nom for parsing, nalgebra for matrix operations, and supports arbitrary precision arithmetic.

Key design decisions:
- Zero-cost abstractions where possible
- Optional parallelization with Rayon
- WASM support for browser deployment
- Minimal dependencies for core functionality

Example:
```rust
let math = MathCore::new();
let derivative = MathCore::differentiate("sin(x^2)", "x")?;
let integral = MathCore::integrate("2*x", "x")?;
let roots = MathCore::solve("x^2 - 5*x + 6", "x")?;
```

The parser handles standard mathematical notation and precedence rules. The engine can evaluate expressions symbolically or numerically with variable substitution.

One interesting challenge was implementing the simplification engine - balancing between aggressive simplification and preserving mathematical structure for further manipulation.

Future plans include GPU acceleration for numerical methods and a Jupyter kernel for interactive use.

Would appreciate feedback on the API design and feature requests!
