Title: MathCore - A symbolic math library for Rust (like SymPy but for Rust!)

Hey Rustaceans! 

I just released MathCore, a symbolic math library that brings computer algebra capabilities to Rust. 

**What it does:**
- Symbolic differentiation/integration  
- Equation solving (algebraic & differential)
- Matrix operations with nalgebra
- Arbitrary precision arithmetic
- FFT and signal processing
- LaTeX output support

**Quick example:**
```rust
use mathcore::MathCore;

let math = MathCore::new();
// Symbolic differentiation
let derivative = MathCore::differentiate("sin(x^2)", "x")?;
// Solve equations
let roots = MathCore::solve("x^2 - 5*x + 6", "x")?;
```

- GitHub: https://github.com/Nonanti/mathcore
- Docs: https://docs.rs/mathcore

Would love feedback and contributions!

Show HN: MathCore â€“ Symbolic Math Library for Rust

I built MathCore to bring symbolic mathematics to Rust, inspired by SymPy and Mathematica.

Key features:
â€¢ Parse and manipulate mathematical expressions symbolically
â€¢ Automatic differentiation and integration
â€¢ Solve differential equations (ODEs and PDEs)
â€¢ Arbitrary precision arithmetic with BigInt/BigRational
â€¢ Parallel computation support with Rayon
â€¢ WASM support for browser applications

The library uses nom for parsing and nalgebra for matrix operations. It's designed to be both powerful and ergonomic.

Example solving a differential equation:
```rust
let ode = DifferentialEquations::solve_ode(
    "y' = -2*y + sin(t)", 
    "t", "y", 
    (0.0, 1.0), // initial condition
    10.0, 1000  // time span and steps
)?;
```

I'd appreciate any feedback on the API design and feature requests!

# Building a Symbolic Math Library in Rust: Introducing MathCore

## Why Rust Needs Symbolic Math

Python has SymPy, JavaScript has math.js, but Rust was missing a comprehensive symbolic math library. That's why I built MathCore.

## What Makes MathCore Special?

1. **Zero-cost abstractions**: Leverages Rust's type system
2. **Memory safety**: No segfaults in your math computations
3. **Parallel by default**: Uses Rayon for parallel operations
4. **WASM support**: Run in browsers

## Quick Tutorial

### Installation
```toml
[dependencies]
mathcore = "0.3.0"
```

### Basic Usage

## Benchmarks
[Performance comparisons...]

## Future Plans
- GPU acceleration
- More numerical methods
- Jupyter kernel support
